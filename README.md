Algorithms and Data Structure with Java - README


Introduction

Welcome to the Algorithms and Data Structure with Java repository! This branch is dedicated to my journey of implementing algorithms and data structures in Java based on the concepts presented in the renowned book "Introduction to Algorithms" by Thomas H. Cormen, Charles E. Leiserson, Ronald L. Rivest, and Clifford Stein.


About the Book

"Introduction to Algorithms" is a widely respected and extensively used textbook in the field of computer science. Authored by experts, it provides a comprehensive introduction to the design and analysis of algorithms and data structures. This repository aims to bring the theoretical knowledge from the book into practical implementation using Java.


Repository Structure

src/: This directory contains the Java source code for various algorithms discussed in the book.

test/: Unit tests and sample input/output for validating the correctness of the algorithms.

bin/: Contains all the compiled Java classes corresponding to the algorithms implemented in this repository.


Acknowledgments

Thanks to the authors of "Introduction to Algorithms" for providing a solid foundation for learning and implementing algorithms.
Happy coding and exploring the fascinating world of algorithms with Java! ðŸš€
